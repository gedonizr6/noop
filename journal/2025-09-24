- i was forced to left the apt i rent
  - the organized that
    - firstly i was tortured with physical pain
      - just before that my phone was powered off due to empty battery
        - and charging didn't work
        - also i couldn't turn on my two other phones
        - so i couldn't call emergency
      - the pain and fear was enough to make me scream
        - i opened window to get neighbors attention 
          - also i hoped this will stop torture 
          - but nothing happened 
      - i asked to call emergency some guys on the street
        - one of them spent ~10 minutes for that but done it(thanks) 
          - i asked to call private ambulance but he didn't managed to do that
      - then i heared neighbors near the front door and crouched there to seek help(call the private ambulance)
        - nobody wanted to do that
          - they started to blame me for the noise
            - one of girl shot me on the phone laughing while i was unable to standup and was struggled with pain
          - i was shocked by such attitude because before that i didn't hear nothing bad from them
      - finally police and ambulance came
        - they also started laughing and blaming so i reject to go with them and closed the door
      - then came strange persones with aggressive voices
        - they call themselves private ambulance
          - i didn't believe and make them knowing it
        - they was kicking the door and shouting for ~5 min. then left
