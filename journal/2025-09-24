    - firstly i was tortured with physical pain
      - just before that my phone was powered off due to empty battery
        - and charging didn't work
        - also i couldn't turn on my two other phones
        - so i couldn't call emergency
      - the pain and fear was enough to make me scream
        - i opened window to get neighbors attention 
          - also i hoped this will stop torture
