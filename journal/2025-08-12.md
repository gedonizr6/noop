now they tortured me almost every day for several hours
- perceived effects was intisified 
- uses mix of several states simultaneously:
  - dizziness 
  - pain in the right leg
  - heartburn 
  - sleepiness
  - nausea 
  - weakness 
  - sweetness 
  - back pain 
  - unsteadiness
- reinforcing the torture verbally
  - intimidating 
  - mockering 
  - blaming 
  - demotivating 
  - etc
- often the intensity is lowering when i do not move and do not think
- all of that makes difficult any activity, making process slower and making the outcomes less quality and usually unacceptable
