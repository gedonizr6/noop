# events
- liza is still here
  - it felt like the Group is felt that staing alone without their controll me using something that they stop using recently - i will became completele unconctrolled which apparently is still undesirable for them
    - so they "sold me" a troyan horse
      - and she continue
        - to broke my things
        - spill liquids
        - make chaos
    - they may say(and they done) that that was because i use drugs or give drugs to Liza
      - but the anti-drug rhetoric is shattered by the fact that she herself, independently of me(i was slept), has bought drugs several times, despite the fact that her bank account, phone and behavior are almost completely controlled by the group

# new patterns
  - distraction from unwanted(intention, thought, etc) using:
    - mobile calls from robots/clerks
    - loud noise from neighbors apartements
      - something dropped
      - open/closed door
    - probably simultaneously starting to communicate somthing to subconscious
      - e.g. something that pushing away from "unwanted" or just something that could hold your attention
# new clues
	- got new small sore(like ulcer) on the back bottom side of the nack
		- it's sometimes felt strange
  		- itching and in the same time a bit numb
  		- when change the neck position or rotation it felts like the skin is glued(when movement of one skin point relatively rigidly pulls another point along with it)
    		- but i can't notice anythin on the skin surface
      		- so there is something under the skin or this is an illusion
  		- sometimes itching intesifies and
  		- one of the Group said that there are a worm and they controlled them
    		- i palpated and felt something like worm(or probably that was just a muscle)
      		- after that the inthing became a pain like the worm is trying to dig on the surface
