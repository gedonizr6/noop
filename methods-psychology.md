# Methods that affect mental states
- emulate the work of subconscious
 - including subconscious with some pathalogy
  - e.g. mimic symptoms of schizophrenia
 - control autonomic nervous system
  - incl. states(body/mind) and feelings
 - generating ideas, thoughts, phrases
- changing context of something to change how percieve it in general
  - if you allow some action from one group of people then you should do that for any groups.
    - e.g. if you would forgieve relatives for mindful intervention of this game for you - then this game is ok and you should be thankful
- "fork"
  - form the circumstanes in such a way that victim believe he has only one possible way
  - often the victim feels like that was he who choose this way
- playing background sounds
 - e.g. often music
 - e.g. ambient
 - e.g. often heavy and melancholic inducing low spirit
 - e.g. often overdubed on some background sound with detectable source
 - e.g. often or everytime induce nervous tension/strain
 - e.g. often or everytime accompanies hostile behaviour of the Group
- somehow gained access to the victim memory 
 - w/o the victim's aware
 - even from child-age which no one know or rembember
- posible turning on/off left/right brai seprately
- limiting posibilities and resources by telling of their importance
 - the importance is often hidden and difficult to check
 - the ratio of true/lie about this importance is unknown for now
 - e.g. telling that something interesting may be at your storages and leading you to the information about undeleting files may make difficult to use ant storage for writeing.
  - even new because they may tell that new storages was special  for you and you found that they are not empty
- according to the Group they almost always translate to the victim some audio.
 - this audio have two channel L and R which are different
  - each ear hear own isolated channel
  - it's not percived by consciousess 
   - but subconsciousness understand it
