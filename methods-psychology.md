# Methods that affect mental states
- mimic the work of subconscious
 - including subconscious with some pathalogy
  - e.g. mimic symptoms of schizophrenia
 - control autonomic nervous system
  - incl. states(body/mind) and feelings
 - generating ideas, thoughts, phrases
 - inject strong and sustained anchor into memory(free associations)
  - e.g. when see elder person/animal/item etc - think about own decline
  - e.g. everything related to measurment of things - associated with the sense of victim's insufficent genitalia size
   - especially in comparison to the victim's enemies/competitors/other persons etc
- changing context of something to change how the victim percieved it in general
  - if you allow some action from one group of people then you should do that for any groups.
    - e.g. if you would forgieve relatives for mindful intervention of this game for you - then this game is ok and you should be thankful
- "fork"
  - form the circumstanes in such a way that victim believe he has only one possible way
  - often the victim feels like that was he who choose this way
- playing background sounds
 - e.g. often music
 - e.g. ambient
 - e.g. often heavy and melancholic inducing low spirit
 - e.g. often overdubed on some background sound with detectable source
 - e.g. often or everytime induce nervous tension/strain
 - e.g. often or everytime accompanies hostile behaviour of the Group
- somehow gained access to the victim memory
 - w/o the victim's aware
 - even from child-age which no one know or rembember
- posible turning on/off left/right brai seprately
- limiting posibilities and resources by telling of their importance
 - the importance is often hidden and difficult to check
 - the ratio of true/lie about this importance is unknown for now
 - e.g. telling that something interesting may be at your storages and leading you to the information about undeleting files may make difficult to use ant storage for writeing.
  - even new because they may tell that new storages was special  for you and you found that they are not empty
- according to the Group they almost always translate to the victim some audio.

  - it's not percived by consciousess
   - but subconsciousness understand it
- using the verbalized text from audio/video contents the victim may hear
 - from
  - own devices' music playlists(youtube music, etc)
  - shorts or music started by people the victim may met
  - music/audio in public places(ATB supermarket, etc)
 - inducing the feeling that's the lyric relates to me or current situation
 - it often enforces stress, anxiety and fears
  - but never weakens them nor does it do any good
- provokes to stop doing things you think right at the moment
 - by suggesting that the victim is participating in some show and the audience wouldn't having fan watching that
 - turning on feeling of intence discomfort
 - using repetitive actions by a nearby person that could be interpreted as criticism

    - the mocking intonaions are obvious
    - the phrases triggered by the victim's actions
- consistently repeating that the victim should masturbate or having sex N hours per day/today/yesterday
