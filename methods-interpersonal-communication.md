- intentional communicating in such way that the victim is unable to achieve a certainty at anything
- quite whispering
- saying in opposite direction of the victim
- mixing with continious or short noises
- e.g. throwing something on the floor
- e.g. sound of air-conditioner
- this leads to
- amplyfying the victim's doubts and inducing new ones
  - then the group trying to remove/lowering these doubts
  - if succeess - the victim takes initative/esponsibility and do some actions
  - then the group:
    - sabotages the process
    - sabotages outcomes
    - sabotage percieving of the victim's own action
    - critique
    - suggesting that sabotages was just a
    - friendful joke
    - provocation for learning purposes
    - all that repeating constantly AND leads to lowering the initative of the victim
  - meanwhile the victim's self-choosen actions also critisized and provocations to do suspicious questionable action continue
