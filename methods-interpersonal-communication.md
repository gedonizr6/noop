- intentional communicating in such way that the victim is unable to achieve a certainty at anything
 - quite whispering 
 - saying in opposite direction of the victim 
 - mixing with continious or short noises
  - e.g. throwing something on the floor
  - e.g. sound of air-conditioner
 - this leads to
  - amplyfying the victim's doubts and inducing new ones
    - then the group trying to remove/lowering these doubts
     - if succeess - the victim takes initative/esponsibility and do some actions
      - then the group:
        - sabotages the process
        - sabotages outcomes
        - sabotage percieving of the victim's own action 
         - critique
         - suggesting that sabotages was just a
          - friendful joke
          - provocation for learning purposes
      - all that leads to lowering the initative of the victim
      - and this repeating constantly
