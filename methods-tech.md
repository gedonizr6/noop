- lockpicking
- installing and using network of hidden cams
  - possibly, communicating/powering using wet insulators
    - any building/interior material
  - pros:
    - the group knows what the victim is doing
    - the agents of the group consistently increased humidity of the apt by
      - spill liquids
      - urinating
      - forcing endless laundry by
        - urinating on sheets/matress/textile
        - put on the victim's clothes, dirty them and change them for new ones every few hours
        - provoke the washing machine to break down during the program, forcing it to start over
        - provoke fear and guilt because of the noise of the washing machine
        - possibly making the washing machine generating
          - more louder noise
          - adding artificial/controlled noise
- using AI for:
 - generating adult videos with replaced:
  - environent
  - actor faces and body features
  - sounds producing by actors
  - background  music
- turn on/off internet
- slow down devices
  - or completely freezing
- reboot cell phones
- change battery charge level
  - to 0 with shutdown
  - to 100% without chargeing
- somehow controll/ddos devices without any active connections
  - pc
    - possible has hidden bluetooth/wifi/etc
    - possible controlled over electrical power line by changeing frequency and/or modulation
      - which can read by common saund interface(possible)
    - possible by directed narrow EM radiation
  - smart phones
  - measurement devices
    - multimeter
      - was observed sporadic values coinciding with direct confirmation from the group
    - flamable gas detector
      - was observed sporadic values coinciding with direct confirmation from the group
- manipulating the content of the website
  - looks like a website's own personalisaion mechanism
    - but this personalization is global in nature and consistent with the common narrative of the Group on almost all websites that are not connected to each other
      - possibly men-in-the-middle attack
- music playlist to manipulate somehow
  - like it's the result of service(youtube music, etc)
  - use some techniques for suggesting by theese playlists
- Generate fake certificate of any domain and make them trusted on victim's devices
  - possibly, by changing the root certificates on the victim's devices
  - possibly, by having the private keys of the CA
    - stealing
    - brutforced
      - botnet
      - quantum computers
    - gained by authority(gov/military/security agencies)
